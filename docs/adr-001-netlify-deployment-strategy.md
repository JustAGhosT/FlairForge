**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-01-15  
**Deciders:** FlairForge Development Team  
**Consulted:** DevOps Team, Frontend Team  
**Informed:** Product Team, Stakeholders  

## Context and Problem Statement

FlairForge is an AI-powered flyer generation application built with React frontend and Express.js backend. We need to choose a deployment platform that can handle both the static frontend and server-side functionality while providing good performance, scalability, and developer experience.

### Problem

We need to deploy a full-stack application with:

- React frontend with TypeScript and Vite
- Express.js backend API for flyer generation
- EJS template rendering
- AI integration capabilities
- File upload and processing
- Real-time preview generation

### Goals

- Minimize deployment complexity and maintenance overhead
- Ensure fast global content delivery
- Provide automatic scaling and high availability
- Support modern development workflows
- Maintain cost-effectiveness for MVP and growth phases

### Non-Goals

- Building custom infrastructure
- Managing server instances
- Complex container orchestration
- Multi-cloud deployment strategy

### Success Criteria

- Deployment time < 5 minutes from git push
- Global CDN with < 100ms response times
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Automatic SSL certificate management

## Decision Drivers

### Technical Drivers

- React SPA with client-side routing
- Serverless API requirements
- Static asset optimization needs
- Environment variable management
- CI/CD integration requirements

### Business Drivers

- Rapid MVP development and iteration
- Cost-effective hosting for startup phase
- Global user base requirements
- Time-to-market constraints
- Limited DevOps resources

### Cognitive Mesh Drivers

- Foundation layer compatibility for data processing
- Business layer integration for user workflows
- Agency layer requirements for security and permissions

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Netlify (Frontend + Functions)

**Description:** Deploy React frontend to Netlify with backend API as serverless functions

**Pros:**

- ✅ Excellent developer experience with git-based deployments
- ✅ Built-in CDN and global edge network
- ✅ Automatic SSL and security headers
- ✅ Serverless functions for backend API
- ✅ Zero configuration for React/Vite builds
- ✅ Built-in form handling and redirects
- ✅ Free tier suitable for MVP

**Cons:**

- ❌ Function execution time limits (10s free, 15s paid)
- ❌ Cold start latency for serverless functions
- ❌ Limited server-side processing capabilities
- ❌ Vendor lock-in to Netlify platform

**Cost/Effort:** Low

**Risk:** Medium

**Mesh Impact:** Compatible with Foundation and Business layers, may require adaptation for complex Reasoning layer operations

### Option 2: Vercel + External API

**Description:** Deploy frontend to Vercel with backend on separate cloud platform

**Pros:**

- ✅ Excellent React/Vite support
- ✅ Global edge network
- ✅ Serverless functions with longer timeouts
- ✅ Better cold start performance
- ✅ More flexible backend options

**Cons:**

- ❌ More complex deployment setup
- ❌ Higher operational overhead
- ❌ Additional costs for backend hosting
- ❌ More complex environment management

**Cost/Effort:** Medium

**Risk:** Medium

**Mesh Impact:** Good separation of concerns but requires additional integration work

### Option 3: AWS Amplify

**Description:** Full-stack deployment on AWS Amplify with Lambda functions

**Pros:**

- ✅ Full AWS ecosystem integration
- ✅ Scalable Lambda functions
- ✅ Advanced security features
- ✅ Comprehensive monitoring
- ✅ Enterprise-grade reliability

**Cons:**

- ❌ Steeper learning curve
- ❌ Higher complexity for simple applications
- ❌ More expensive for small scale
- ❌ AWS vendor lock-in

**Cost/Effort:** High

**Risk:** Low

**Mesh Impact:** Excellent for enterprise deployments but overkill for MVP

### Assumptions

- Application will not require complex server-side processing initially
- Function execution time limits are acceptable for current use cases
- Cost will remain within budget for foreseeable future

### Open Questions

- How will we handle complex file processing if function limits become restrictive?
- What is the migration path if we need more robust server-side capabilities?

### Future Considerations

- Monitor function execution patterns and performance
- Evaluate need for dedicated backend services as application scales
- Consider multi-region deployment for global performance optimization
