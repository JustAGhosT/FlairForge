# __scripts__/

This directory contains custom test runners, orchestration scripts, and test utilities for the FlairForge project.

- Place all custom Node.js scripts for running, orchestrating, or reporting on tests here.
- Example: `test-runner.js` runs all unit and E2E tests and prints a summary.
- Scripts here may be referenced by npm scripts, CI workflows, or run manually.
